<p>Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.<img src="../../Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/4/4211DC6A-FEE1-4397-BB3B-AD49F1251DD7.jpeg" width="500" height="300" alt=""/></p>
	According to the current system of classification, there are four primary AI types: reactive, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-aware.
	<p>1.Reactive machines are the most basic type of unsupervised AI. This means that they cannot form memories or use past experiences to influence present-made decisions; they can only react to currently existing situations ‚Äì hence ‚Äúreactive.‚Äù</p>
		<p>
		An existing form of a reactive machine is Deep Blue, a chess-playing supercomputer created by IBM in the mid-1980s. Deep Blue was created to play chess against a human competitor with the intent to defeat the competitor.Limited memory is a type of artificial intelligence. It refers to an AI's ability to store previous data and predictions, using that data to make better predictions. With limited memory, ML architecture becomes a little more complex.Reinforcement Learning:These models learn to make better predictions through many cycles of trial and error. This kind of model teaches computers how to play games like chess.</p><img src="../../Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary/originals/4/4211DC6A-FEE1-4397-BB3B-AD49F1251DD7.jpeg" width="500" height="300" alt=""><p></p>
